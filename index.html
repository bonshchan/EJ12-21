       present to you some developmental concepts and tools along software design
       and developments. This module gives emphasis on types of prototypes, phases
       of prototype development and designing prototypes of web, mobile, and
       business information systems.</li>
       
       <br>
       
       <li><b>Module 5: SOFTWARE TESTING AND DEPLOYMENT.</b> 
       This module aims to
       impart understanding on the conduct of software testing and deployment. In
       this module, it highlights types of software testing, areas for system testing,
       and developing a test plan. Likewise, it presents concepts about software
       deployment process and areas for consideration for a deployment plan in
       preparation for the development of a deployment plan template.</li>
       <br>
       <li><b>Module 6: ETHICAL AND LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS.</b> This module aims to
